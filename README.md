# Production Performance of Oil Wells
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Volve field production performance based on historical data. Machine Learning models are employed to uncover valuable insights and provide business recommendations.

## Description
The Volve field is a significant offshore oil and gas field located in the North Sea, operated by Equinor. This project leverages the publicly available Volve dataset to conduct an in-depth analysis of the field's production performance. By utilizing Machine Learning techniques, we aim to identify patterns, predict future performance, and offer actionable insights to optimize operations and enhance decision-making processes.

## Installations
To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Download the Python notebook named "Project_Oil_Well_Production_Performance_on_Volve_Dataset.ipynb" from this repository, which contains the source code.
2. Install Anaconda, a popular distribution of Python and data science packages, from the official website: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook from the Anaconda Navigator or the command line.

## Dependencies
The project relies on several Python libraries and packages. To install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt (or the terminal/command prompt on your system).
2. Navigate to the project directory using the cd command.
3. Run the following commands to install the necessary packages using the pip package manager:
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install matplotlib-base
pip install seaborn
pip install scikit-learn

## Dataset
The project utilizes the Volve dataset provided by Equinor, which is publicly available at the following URL: https://www.equinor.com/energy/volve-data-sharing
This dataset contains various production-related data, including well trajectories, well logs, production rates, and other relevant information.

## Usage

1. After installing the required dependencies, open the "Project_Oil_Well_Production_Performance_on_Volve_Dataset.ipynb" notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Execute the code cells sequentially to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training.
3. The notebook provides detailed explanations, visualizations, and results at each step of the analysis process.
4. Feel free to modify the code or explore different approaches to gain further insights or enhance the analysis.
